## *Page Currently Under Construction*

After my undergrad at UBC Okanagan in 2019, I bought a 2005 Mercedes Sprinter with the dream of converting it into a full time camper van. I wanted to use this to travel along the Pacific West Coast. I had recently gained a strong interest in outdoor rock climbing, so the plan was to build out this van with the basic bells and whistles (I only had a month) before I started my venture south towards Los Angeles where my brother was at the time.

I gained some valuable handy-work skills from my father (an engineer who spend a lot of time working on projects around the house) and, with the help of a lot of YouTube videos and the occasional blog post, I felt I had the skills to build a fully functional, off-grid camper van.

Below are some snapshots along the building process.

This page is currently a work in progress.

Its 2025 and I still own the van! I use it daily from little commutes (not exactly the most convenient) to big road trips (extremely convenient). I cannot think of a better vehicle for adventures, something that I seek often, including hiking, skiing, camping, climbing, and other back country adventures!
