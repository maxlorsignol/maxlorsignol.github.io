This page contains all the files you need to set up your own E-Portfolio using Quarto & GitHub. To use these files, 'fork' this repository. Using your Github Desktop app, you can then 'fetch the origin' - aka pull these files onto your computer, and make edits. Personalize your page by opening the Quarto (qmd) files in R-Studio and adding your content. Once you are finished adding content, make sure you commit all of your edits to your GitHub repository. 

Once all edits have been committed, you will be able to view your website by navigating to Settings > Pages. You will need to select which Branch GitHub should use to make your page - for most of you this will be the 'main' branch. Please note your repository will have to be made public in order for this to work. In order to make your repository public, navigate to General > Danger Zone > Change repository visibility. Once you have completed all the steps above, it may take a few minutes for your page to be rendered. Once completed, your website url will be available to you under the Settings > Pages tab. 

For example, here is the website for this template https://ubc-mgem-fcor599.github.io/E-Portfolio/
