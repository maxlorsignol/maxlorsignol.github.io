    "text": "Hi, my name is Max Lorsignol.\nI am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at UBC. What is geomatics, you ask? In a nutshell, geomatics is the science and technology of collecting, analyzing, managing, and visualizing spatial data. Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the maps my father used for his mountaineering adventures. Today, I’m leveraging that lifelong love for mapping and applying it with modern tools and standards to be a part of the conservation and environmental efforts of the 21st century.\nWhen I’m not crafting digital maps or doing spatial analyses, you’ll find me outdoors, navigating the rugged mountains of the west coast with the same passion for exploration. My goal is to combine the skills I’ve developed through my education and personal experiences to address pressing issues related to environmental management, natural resources, climate change, and land use management. I hope to make a meaningful difference in creating sustainable solutions for the challenges our world faces today.\n\n\n\nGIF of a forest plot with Individual Trees Segmented using li2012, colorized by TreeID"

    "text": "This project focuses on identifying and designating Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs) within the Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Region. Using geospatial data from BC Parcel Data, CPCAD, and ecological sensitivity datasets, the study aims to assess parcels of land for their potential to support biodiversity conservation while meeting the criteria for OECM designation. The methodology involves creating a “mesh sensitivity layer” that integrates critical habitat data, forest age (&gt;200 years), and proximity to streams, combined with parcel attributes like ownership and zoning.\nSpatial analysis, guided by a decision support tool, evaluates parcels based on ecological sensitivity, proximity to existing conservation areas, and governance capacity. The project also examines differences across regional districts (Metro Vancouver, Sunshine Coast, Squamish Lillooet), aiming to prioritize parcels that are unprotected but ecologically significant. Expected results include a map of high-priority OECM candidates, helping to enhance biodiversity conservation while contributing to Canada’s broader conservation goals under the CBD’s Aichi Targets.\n\n\nEach hexagon has a value based on the ecological sensitivity, critical habitat, forest age, proximity to streams and slope steepness.

Fascinated by different classification processes and the maps it produced, I extended this skill to produce a number of classified maps of various landscapes where Landsat and Copernicus satellite data was available. Generally my focus was with the Howe Sound Biosphere as it was part of my capstone project at UBC and is where I spend my time hiking, skiing and climbing. Below are some of the results of recent pixel classifications.\nBelow is a slide-by-side comparison of two different classification processes of the Howe Sound. The left side is classified under a supervised process using hand-delineated polygons, 20/80 training to validation, with custom R code (a lot of work). The right shows a classification using the ArcGIS Pro deeplearning land cover classification (almost instantaneous).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea here is to visualize the difference and address the accuracies between the two classification models. How do you think they compare?"

I applied the BFAST algorithm to detect abrupt changes in vegetation—like logging events—that cause rapid declines in NDVI values. I then examined a 33‐year series of land cover maps from Landsat imagery, reclassifying the data into forested and non-forested areas to evaluate trends in forest loss and gain. Throughout the lab, I developed R code for data extraction, time series creation, and visualization, showcasing my practical skills in spatial and temporal analysis with packages such as terra, sf, and bfast."

By computing NDVI and NBR indices, I quantify fire impact and track regrowth over time. Additionally, I classify burn severity using dNBR thresholds and examine recovery patterns across severity classes.\nThis analysis is valuable for forest management, wildfire risk assessment, and ecological monitoring, helping decision-makers understand fire dynamics and long-term landscape recovery. Similar methodologies can be applied to other wildfire-prone regions, post-disaster assessments (e.g., volcanic eruptions, floods), and habitat restoration projects, providing critical insights for conservation and land-use planning.\n\nLoad in necessary packages\n\n#Attach packages here\nlibrary(terra)\n\nWarning: package 'terra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\nWarning: package 'sf' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 - Historical Fire Analysis:\nIdentify total fires and area burned in 2017.

Using data from a variety of sources, the study aims to assess parcels of land for their potential to support biodiversity conservation while meeting the criteria for OECM designation. The methodology involves creating a weighted suitability model that integrates critical habitat data, forest age, slope, streams buffer, parks buffer, wetlands and watersheds to make an initial parcel selection from the BC Parcel Fabric. Initial parcels are then further filtered by parcel attributes like ownership, class and zoning.\nIn the Weighted Layer, each hexagon has a value based on the a weighted suitability model. Darker values represent more sensitive areas and lighter values are less sensitive.\nUsing the suitability mesh layer in conjunction with the BC Fabric Parcel layer, I can select parcels that intersect with areas of the mesh based on a specified threshold.

By computing NDVI and NBR indices, I quantify fire impact and track regrowth over time. Additionally, I classify burn severity using dNBR thresholds and examine recovery patterns across severity classes.\nThis analysis is valuable for forest management, wildfire risk assessment, and ecological monitoring, helping decision-makers understand fire dynamics and long-term landscape recovery.

If we use ModelA, we have to calculate the 25th percentile.\nWe will use pixel_metrics function in lidR and the app function in terra.\nLets calculate grid_metrics for all MKRF. We need to calculate the zq25 metric for each pixel because depending on the template it can be for each pixel of a raster (area-based approach), or each polygon, or each segmented tree, or on the whole point cloud. In our case we will be doing every pixel. For the time sake, the spatial resolution will be set to 10 meters.\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\n# Calculate grid_metrics for all MKRF \n# Create LAScatalog of filtered, normalized tiles with points 2 m - 65 m \nnorm_cat_mkrf &lt;- readLAScatalog(\"~/GEM 521/Lab 2/Data/Normalized\") # read in Normalized LAS file from Lab2\nopt_filter(norm_cat_mkrf) &lt;- '-keep_z_above 2 -drop_z_above 65' # remove points above 65m and below 2 meters\n\n#Calculate grid metrics of mean Z at 10 m resolution for entire study area\npixel_metrics_mkrf &lt;- pixel_metrics(norm_cat_mkrf, .stdmetrics_z, 10) \nplot(pixel_metrics_mkrf)\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the MKRF pixel metrics\n\n\nLook at all the rasters we have created. We can plot individual rasters using variations of plot(pixel_metrics_mkrf). For this model, we want to extract the zq25 raster from this SpatRaster. We can do that by using the subset function in the terra package. Let’s plot the extracted SpatRaster to confirm it was successful.\nAfter extracting the 25th percentile for each pixel across the study area we can apply Model 2. To do this, we first need to write a function that will apply this equation to all pixels in zq25_mkrf. The function we will create is based on the coefficients derived from Model 2. And lets apply that function to the entire MKRF study area.\n\n\nShow/Hide Code\nzq25_mkrf &lt;- terra::subset(pixel_metrics_mkrf, \"zq25\") # assign the subset zq25 metric to a variable\n\n# function based on Model2 (ModelB) coefficients\nf &lt;- function(x) {\n  24.96* x -139.45\n}\n\n#Apply function to raster\nnet_volume_mkrf &lt;- terra::app(zq25_mkrf, f) # apply function f to the zq25 metric across the entire area\nplot(net_volume_mkrf,\n     main = 'Estimated Volume using ModelB',) # plot, in 2D, the estimated volume based on our model\n\n\n\n\n\n2D visualization of the Volume based on the model"

    "text": "In this report, I focus on LiDAR data processing, forest attribute estimation, and model development using R. I begin by loading the necessary libraries, including lidR, terra, tidyverse, MASS, and corrplot, to facilitate LiDAR data processing, geospatial raster operations, statistical modeling, and visualization.\nTo prepare the data, I read LiDAR tiles (.las files) into a LAScatalog object, filter and normalize the point cloud using DEM-based normalization, and extract individual plots while ensuring the removal of duplicate points. I then generate Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and Canopy Height Models (CHM) to provide spatial context for further analysis.\nFollowing this, I compute standard LiDAR cloud metrics such as mean height (zmean), maximum height (zmax), median height (zq50), and standard deviation (zsd). These metrics allow me to analyze forest structure across individual plots and the entire study area. I explore relationships between these LiDAR metrics and vegetation attributes, visualizing correlations and patterns.\nTo estimate forest attributes, I develop linear regression models for Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and Dominant Height (DH) based on LiDAR metrics. Using stepwise variable selection, I optimize the model to improve predictive accuracy. I evaluate model performance by analyzing correlation matrices and comparing predicted values against measured data.\nOnce the best-fit models are identified, I apply them to LiDAR-derived rasters to generate spatial predictions of AGB and DH across the study area. By performing raster algebra, I compute differences between predicted and actual values, assessing the model’s effectiveness. Finally, I export the processed data and model outputs as .csv files for further analysis.\nThroughout this process, I use various visualization techniques, including plotting LiDAR-derived metrics, DEMs, CHMs, and model results. I also generate correlation matrices to examine relationships between different variables and validate the accuracy of my models.\nOverall, this report presents a complete LiDAR processing pipeline, from raw .las files to model-based forest attribute estimation. By integrating spatial data analysis, raster computation, and statistical modeling, I develop a data-driven approach to assessing forest structure and biomass distribution."

The objective is to detect trees, individually, by using two different algorithms.\nThe (Li et al. 2012) method relies on a local maxima filtering approach applied to a Canopy Height Model (CHM). I smooth the CHM to reduce noise and extract tree tops using a variable window size, ensuring better accuracy in detecting dominant trees and visualize the detected trees and assess the segmentation results.\nThe (Dalponte and Coomes 2016) method incorporates a marker-controlled watershed segmentation, which refines tree crown delineation based on spectral and structural characteristics. Using a Gaussian smoothing filter and use the tree segmentation function in lidR to identify tree crowns, I compare the results with the Li et al. method to evaluate their effectiveness. Throughout this process, I fine-tune parameters such as smoothing intensity, window size, and threshold values to optimize tree detection accuracy. The results allow me to assess the effectiveness of these ITD methods in forest structure analysis and remote sensing applications."

    "text": "In this lab, I analyze the burn severity of the 2017 Prouton Lakes wildfire using Landsat 8 time-series data (2013–2021) to assess vegetation loss and post-fire recovery. By computing NDVI and NBR indices, I quantify fire impact and track regrowth over time. Additionally, I classify burn severity using dNBR thresholds and examine recovery patterns across severity classes.\nThis analysis is valuable for forest management, wildfire risk assessment, and ecological monitoring, helping decision-makers understand fire dynamics and long-term landscape recovery. Similar methodologies can be applied to other wildfire-prone regions, post-disaster assessments (e.g., volcanic eruptions, floods), and habitat restoration projects, providing critical insights for conservation and land-use planning.\n\nLoad in necessary packages\n\n\nCode\n#| execute: false\n#| eval: false\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Show/Hide Code\"\n\n#Attach packages\n\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\n\n\nStep 1 - Historical Fire Analysis:\nIdentify total fires and area burned in 2017.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis study aims to investigate the relationship between nesting habitats of the Marbled Murrelet and mapped sensitive ecosystems on Gambier Island in British Columbia. Using a patch-based connectivity model evaluating habitat availability called Grains of Connectivity (GoC), the research will focus on the critical habitat of the Marbled Murrelet and their spatial relation to existing Old Growth Management Areas (OGMA). This study aims to provide insight on the habitat fragmentation and the spatial connectivity in hopes to provide leverage for effectively conserving this critical species at risk and fragile ecosystems.\nGambier Island, also known as Cha7élkwnech in the Squamish language, is located in the Howe Sound near Vancouver, BC. Encompassing roughly 70 square kilometers of complex landscapes and sensitive ecosystems (Figure 1), the present forests serve as important habitats for a range of endangered species (Butler et al., n.d.). The historical pressures from logging, human settlement, and recreation have affected the biodiversity of the landscape and requires vigilant assessment to maintain a healthy ecosystem.\nThe Marbled Murrelet is a threatened seabird that has the potential to be strongly influenced by forest fragmentation and edge effects (Malt and Lank 2009). They spend most of their time searching for food in coastal waters, but unlike other seabirds, they can fly up to 50km inland to nest (Nelson 2020) and are strongly associated with late-successional and old-growth forests, buildings its’ nests on large branches in tall trees (Raphael, Mack, and Cooper 2002). The species was listed under the Species at Risk Act in 2012 and has been identified as a priority for conservation in many regional conservation strategies in Canada (Bertram et al. 2015).\n\n\nMethods\nThe data for this study comes from two primary data sources. The first source is the Island Trust, a special purpose government serving the islands in the Salish Sea and Howe Sounds responsible for preserving and protecting the islands’ environments (Forests, n.d.). The second source is the Critical Habitat for Species at Risk National Dataset of Canada created by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) for terrestrial species (Canada and Change, n.d.). These two data sets will be analyzed using R and ArcGIS Pro software and serve for the ecological network connectivity analysis.\nThe first step in this analysis is to rasterize the Sensitive Ecosystem Mapping (SEM) Air photo such that it can be used to create a land classification for the connectivity analysis. The second step is to do a similar rasterization of the Marbled Murrelet data and attribute link threshold characteristics to the seabird data set like flight distance capabilities and preferential flight pathing. Similarly, resistance values need to be assigned to the terrestrial classified landscape in order to create a minimum planar graph (MPG). These resistance values will affect the movement of Marbled Murrelet through the landscape and are necessary to understand the species connectivity and reliance on specific ecosystems.\n\n\n\nGambier Island Sensitive Ecosystem Mapping for Gambier Island\n\n\nAfter the rasterization and landscape reclassification of the SEM, OGMA and Marbled Murrelet habitat, a series of ecological analyses will be performed. Specifically, a network analysis utilizing the MPG to create a least-cost path model for the Marbled Murrelet, and with varying threshold values, a grains of connectivity (GoC) analysis. A variety of landscape metrics using the landscapemetrics package in R will be applied to the reclassified ecosystems including PLAND (percentage of landscape), NP (number of patches), CAI_MN (mean of core area index), LPI (largest patch index) and other metrics useful to determine the fragmentation and ecosystem edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: National Landcover Data for Howe Sound, Based on August 2023 data set.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have our classified landscape, we can use the landscape metrics to extract the core areas and patches using specific landscape_metrics functions. Below is the resulting core areas of the Howe Sound landscape.\n Now that we have our core areas, lets compare structural connectivity between barren land, evergreen forests, and low developed classes.\nWe’ll compare the following metrics at the class-level:\n\nCAI_MN: Mean of core area index (Core area metric)\nCOHESION: Patch Cohesion Index (Aggregation metric)\nLPI: Largest patch index (Area and Edge metric)\nNP: Number of patches (Aggregation metric)\nPLAND: Percentage of landscape of class (Area and Edge metric)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Values for structural connectivity metrics for the current landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Results & Significance\nThis study is expected to show a connection between the preferred nesting habitats of the Marbled Murrelet, where they are located in relation to the mapped ecosystems on Gambier Island, and their proximity to the OGMAs. The analysis will likely reveal that edge forests, old growths, and other mature forested areas on the Island correlate to the birds’ nesting habitat, in other words, provide crucial habitat sites for the species. There will likely be a connection between the extent of forested edges and its influence on the nesting habitats as the Murrelet.\nThe connectivity analysis will highlight the links between the critical habitats and classified ecosystems, identifying preferential pathways for the Murrelet as well as barriers to their movement. It is likely that the values of calculated metrics will confirm the fragmentated state of the bird’s habitat and current OGMAs, supporting the need for further improvement of land protection and conservation efforts. It will link the locality and fragmentation of the OGMAs to Gambier’s SEM and Murrelet habitat. Ultimately, by identifying critical connections and areas of fragmentation, this study will inform future efforts to reduce habitat loss and improve landscape connectivity for species conservation on Gambier Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBertram, Douglas F., Mark C.

    "text": "Authors: Genevieve Doiron & Max Lorsignol\n\n\nCortes Island is home to approximately 1000 year-round residents dispersed between the communities of Cortes Bay, Whaletown, Squirrel Cove and Mansons Landing (“Our Community” 2013). The community is diverse both in age and background. Including working professionals, young families, and retirees. Professions on the Island include “farmers, loggers, artists, educators, retirees” and those seeking a slower pace of life (“Our Community” 2013). Their core values include independence, community connection, economic security, and preservation of nature. The communities on the island are close-knit, with active participation in community events and initiatives by locals of all ages (“Our Community” 2013). They are connected by their shared desire to live independently, yet collaboratively, in a rural and natural setting. The values of self-reliance and resource based livelihoods are echoed in many of their chosen professions as farmers, loggers, and crafts-people. The communities on the island are quite rural, much of the appeal to live there is the area’s rugged wilderness and natural beauty, which also underpins the island’s tourism industry. With regards to the Cortes Forestry General Partnership community members value the forest through their personal connection to nature as well as their reliance on the forest and other natural resources for their livelihoods (Bullock and Hanna 2012). Messaging should appeal to ethos and pathos; ethos through the delivery of the message from trusted and respected community members and pathos through an appeal to their emotional connection to the land and their community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Art (by Max Lorsignol) representing the Local, Non-Indigenous People of Cortes\n\n\nRenewing the forest agreement is essential to ensuring that the voices of Cortes residents remain at the heart of decisions that shape our future. This agreement is crafted by us, for us—those who live here, understand this land, and are committed to its well-being. Outsiders should not determine the future of our island; we know our community and what it needs to thrive. This agreement protects our right to support each other and secure a sustainable future. It will bring us jobs, strengthening our local economy, and safeguard the forest, ensuring its health for generations to come. Together, we can shape the future of Cortes, protecting both our people and our environment.\nThe core message of renewing the forest agreement directly appeals to the values of independence, community, livelihoods, and connection to nature that are central to Cortes Island residents. By centering that the agreement ensures decisions about the future of the island are made by those who live there, the message upholds the community’s desire for self-reliance and local control. It also highlights the economic benefits of sustainable forestry, promising job creation and a thriving local economy without compromising the island’s natural resources.\nThe message appeals to the strong emotional bond residents have with the island’s wilderness. It positions the renewed agreement as a way to safeguard the forest for future generations, resonating with their commitment to preserving the environment as well as the multi-generational nature of the community. It offers a vision of ecological sustainability, where the forest is preserved not only for the current generation but for their children and grandchildren as well. Cortes Island is a close-knit community, where collaboration and mutual support are integral to daily life. By emphasizing that the agreement is crafted by residents, for residents, the message highlights the role of the community in shaping its own future. It reminds residents that, together, they can make decisions that benefit both people and the land, fostering a sense of unity and collective responsibility. It encourages residents to unite in protecting both the land and their way of life, ensuring that Cortes remains the vibrant community they love.\nThe message focuses on community more than the economic benefits of the partnership because people tend to respond most strongly to appeals on emotion. Words such as “us”, “together”, “heart”, and “protect” were used to invoke an emotional response towards security and closeness, such that the residents would opt to stay with the status quo. This message would be best delivered by trusted and respected community members, appealing to ethos and pathos at once. The visual is meant to support the message by depicting the beautiful nature they love with the vibrant diverse and inter-generational community it supports. The forest is drawn as lush and vibrant, framing the resource as the center of the discussion and alluding to the fact that supporting the agreement would support the forest health.\n\n\n\nThe British Columbia Ministry of Forests is committed to a sustainable and competitive forest sector that prioritizes forest stewardship, worker support, innovation, and climate resilience. The Ministry values collaboration with First Nations, industry, and other stakeholders to ensure that forest management practices are effective, inclusive, and forward-thinking (Forests, n.d.). Generally their framework is guided by western ideologies, scientific research and economic priorities. While they publicize their commitment to integrate Indigenous knowledge systems within that framework, historically the approach is of a western, empirical and policy driven perspective. That being said, as a government body, the Ministry is also deeply concerned with public perception and voter approval. As such, they would likely respond to messaging that aligns itself with their public priorities. They would be seeking to demonstrate that the forest policies they promote benefit both the environment and local communities.\nMessaging to the Ministry should appeal to logos, emphasizing the proven track record of the CFGP in successfully balancing environmental sustainability, local job creation, and community collaboration. Governments are typically resistant to change, especially when existing solutions are working, so highlighting the cooperative’s successful model will help reinforce the idea that this approach is effective, trusted, and aligned with the Ministry’s goals for sustainability and public support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Art (by Max Lorsignol) representing the Minitstry of Forests, forward thinking approach\n\n\nThe Cortes Forestry General Partnership (CFGC) has proven success; it is economically viable, environmentally responsible, and widely supported. Through four community-backed harvests, the CFGC has shown the effectiveness of a public, private, resident, and Indigenous cooperation. The partnership has strengthened the local economy, created jobs, and preserved the island’s natural resources. The best path forward is one with a proven foundation, built brick by brick by the community it supports. The best path forward is together.\nThe core message directly appeals to the Ministry of Forests’ focus on sustainability, economic viability, and public support. The message is grounded in logos, highlighting the proven success of CFGP in balancing environmental stewardship, job creation, and community collaboration. The message appeals to the government’s goal to create a competitive forest sector by referring to the successful harvests and jobs created. It also appeals to ethos by stating that the forestry practices of the agreement are scientifically grounded.\nAs well, the emphasis on community support is particularly relevant to the Ministry, as public perception and voter approval are critical factors in government decision-making. The successful integration of local residents and the Klahoose First Nation through the CFGP showcases a collaborative approach that the government seeks to foster. As well given past disagreements and protests from the First Nation and non-Indigenous community members with forestry companies (Bullock and Hanna 2012), highlighting the community support of the agreement also positions it as superior to previous approaches. The visual created supports this message by showing government officials, community members, and First Nations leaders collaborating in a round table discussion. The visual depicts this happening in the forest, which is drawn as lush and vibrant with towering trees. This is in order to center the resource and frame it as prosperous and healthy while shown in tandem with heavy machinery – depicting a sustainable forest industry. Government’s are typically risk averse and resistant to change, especially when a plan is working effectively. The message directly plays to this understanding by stating the agreement’s success and questioning any reason for change. The message clearly positions renewing the agreement as the proven, popular, and politically advantageous option."
